-- Final Cleanup: Address Remaining Performance Warnings
-- This migration fixes the last few RLS policy optimization issues

-- Fix 1: saved_invoices "Require active subscription for invoice access" policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Require active subscription for invoice access" ON "public"."saved_invoices";
CREATE POLICY "Require active subscription for invoice access"
ON "public"."saved_invoices"
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id 
    AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM "public"."user_tool_subscriptions" uts
        JOIN "public"."tools" t ON uts.tool_id = t.id
        WHERE uts.user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
        AND t.slug = 'invoice-reconciler'
        AND uts.status IN ('active', 'trial')
        AND (uts.expires_at IS NULL OR uts.expires_at > NOW())
        AND (uts.trial_ends_at IS NULL OR uts.trial_ends_at > NOW())
    )
);

-- Fix 2: leads table multiple INSERT policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can submit leads" ON "public"."leads";
-- Update the existing "Optimized admin leads access" to handle both admin and public access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Optimized admin leads access" ON "public"."leads";
CREATE POLICY "Consolidated leads access"
ON "public"."leads"
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
    -- Admin can access all leads, others can only insert
    (SELECT auth.role()) = 'service_role'
)
WITH CHECK (
    -- Admin can modify all, authenticated users can insert their own
    (SELECT auth.role()) = 'service_role' 
    OR ((SELECT auth.uid()) IS NOT NULL AND email IS NOT NULL)
);

-- Allow anonymous lead submission (public access)
CREATE POLICY "Public lead submission"
ON "public"."leads"
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR INSERT
TO anon
WITH CHECK (email IS NOT NULL);

-- Fix 3: reconciliation_jobs multiple SELECT policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_view_own_reconciliation_jobs" ON "public"."reconciliation_jobs";
-- Keep only the optimized "Temporary files access control" policy which already handles user access

-- Fix 4: user_tool_subscriptions multiple SELECT policies 
-- Consolidate the two policies into one comprehensive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users view own subscriptions only" ON "public"."user_tool_subscriptions";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Temporary admin access for MVP" ON "public"."user_tool_subscriptions";

CREATE POLICY "Consolidated subscription access"
ON "public"."user_tool_subscriptions"
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR ALL
TO authenticated
USING (
    -- Users can access their own subscriptions, service role can access all
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id 
    OR (SELECT auth.role()) = 'service_role'
)
WITH CHECK (
    -- Users can only modify their own subscriptions, service role can modify all
    (SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id 
    OR (SELECT auth.role()) = 'service_role'
);

-- Add comments for the new consolidated policies
COMMENT ON POLICY "Require active subscription for invoice access" ON "public"."saved_invoices" IS 'Optimized subscription validation with (select auth.uid())';
COMMENT ON POLICY "Consolidated leads access" ON "public"."leads" IS 'Unified admin access with optimized auth functions';
COMMENT ON POLICY "Public lead submission" ON "public"."leads" IS 'Allow anonymous lead submissions';
COMMENT ON POLICY "Consolidated subscription access" ON "public"."user_tool_subscriptions" IS 'Unified user and admin access with performance optimization';
