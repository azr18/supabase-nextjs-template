### Notes

- âœ… **MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED**: Frontend-backend parameter mismatch and database constraints fixed
- âœ… **Upload System Working**: Files upload to Supabase bucket and saved_invoices table correctly
- âœ… **Invoice Management Working**: Saved invoices display and selection works for flydubai airline
- âœ… **Duplicate Detection Working**: System correctly prevents duplicate invoice uploads
- ðŸ”„ **Current Status**: Ready for systematic step-by-step reconciliation process debugging
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next Priority**: Test complete reconciliation processing pipeline step by step
