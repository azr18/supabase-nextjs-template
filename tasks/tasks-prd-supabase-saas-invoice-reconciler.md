### Notes

- All API routes should utilize Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) wherever possible for database operations
- **IMPORTANT - Directory Navigation:**
  - **Next.js commands (npm run dev, npm run build, etc.):** Must be run from `nextjs/` directory
  - **Supabase commands:** Run from `supabase/` directory  
  - **Database migrations:** Run from `supabase/` directory
  - **Root-level commands:** Only for project-wide operations like Playwright tests
  - **PowerShell Syntax:** Use `cd nextjs; npm run dev` or separate commands on new lines
- **Landing Page Gradient Color Scheme (for consistency across all sections):**
  - **Main Headlines:** `from-primary via-blue-600 to-violet-600`
  - **Primary Buttons/CTAs:** `from-gray-800 via-blue-500 to-blue-600`
  - **Secondary Buttons:** `from-blue-600 via-violet-500 to-violet-700`
  - **Feature Icons/Cards:** Progressive gradient flow through blue-violet-purple spectrum:
    - `from-gray-800 via-blue-500 to-blue-600`
    - `from-blue-600 via-blue-500 to-violet-500`
    - `from-blue-500 via-violet-500 to-violet-600`
    - `from-violet-500 via-violet-600 to-purple-600`
    - `from-violet-600 via-purple-500 to-purple-600`
    - `from-purple-500 via-purple-600 to-violet-700`
  - **Background Sections:** `from-gray-800 via-blue-500 to-blue-600` for main sections
  - **Text Colors on Gradients:** `text-white` for icons, `text-blue-100` for descriptive text
  - **Hover Effects:** `hover:scale-105`, `hover:shadow-xl`, `border-blue-200` for consistency
- **Navigation Bar Design:** "My Agent" branded navigation with modern responsive design, featuring blue gradient theme throughout, mobile hamburger menu, smooth animations, and clean anchor link navigation
- **Process Section Design:** Sophisticated brainpool.ai-inspired visual design with meaningful icons for each step, 3D-style step number boxes, enhanced visual hierarchy, phase badges, glow effects, hover animations, and modern timeline section
- **Agentic Testing:** AI agent handles all technical testing including:
  - **Unit Tests:** Component and utility function testing (Jest/Vitest)
  - **Integration Tests:** API endpoint and database integration testing
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Playwright MCP for browser automation, user flows, and UI interactions
  - **Visual Tests:** Playwright for responsive design and visual regression testing
- **User Testing:** User only performs business acceptance testing (does it meet requirements?) after agent completes all technical testing
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` for unit/integration tests
- Use `npx playwright test [optional/test/file]` for end-to-end tests (handled by AI agent)
- Storage bucket policies must enforce 100MB per user quota
- All new database operations should leverage RLS policies for security
- **Testing Protocol:** Each sub-task marked "Test" means the AI agent should write and run automated tests (unit, integration, and Playwright e2e), then demonstrate functionality to user for acceptance
